# Selecting the Appropriate Framework

## **`React`**

**(Developed by Facebook) 2013**

- It’s based on JavaScript
- Create web UI with dynamic HTML components.
- Components are built to encapsulate the state they are in.
- State Encapsulation enables to pass rich data around to handle the state.
- Seamless performance of events handling , state transition, and display data

### Pros Of React

- Virtual DOM is more efficient,lesser time to show up on the screen
- Encapsulated Components, used independently
- Modeled around functional programming
  - Immutable Data
  - Pure Functions
  - Declarative style
- Easy to test , maintain and reuse
- React boasts a large global community
- React is proactive in upgrading and releasing newer versions of the framework.
- SSR (Server Side Rendering), CSR(Client side rendering) or static file generation
- Lesser development time
  - Use of proper libraries can help in reducing devlopment time drastically

### Cons Of React

- Novice developer need to understand JSX
- Too much focus on core library
  - Routing (delegated)
  - Global State Management (Delegated)
- Large projects require strict control around "Flow and data component"

## **`Vue.Js`**

**(Developed by Evan You) 2014**

- Allowing developers to tackle dynamic processes without the need for additional libraries.

### Pros Of Vue.Js

- Vue.js has extensive and concise documentation.
- It uses virtual DOM, which improves rendering efficiency.
- Vue.js is highly integrable. Smaller Vue.js components can be integrated seamlessly.
- It offers reactive and composable view components.
- Templates created from Vue.js are in HTML format.
- The entire framework's size is only 18 kB, making Vue.js incredibly lightweight.

### Cons Of Vue.Js

- Vue.js community is relatively small as it lacks in popularity.
- Most discussions on Vue.js are conducted in Chinese as the framework is highly popular amongst Chinese companies.
- The lack of experienced developers, community support, and component stability issues makes it risky to use Vue.js in large projects.

## **`Angular`**

**(Developed by Google) 2016**

- Based on TypeScript
- Built with the object-oriented programming approach
- Two-way data binding

### Pros Of Angular

- App logic and the UI layer is decoupled with Angular’s Model-View-Controller architecture.
- Supports the separation of concerns.
- Bypass the default DOM-rendering of the template by intercepting the rendering calls.
- Angular has strong support for building and handling dynamic forms.
- RxJS supports reactive programming with observable streams to handle asynchronous code easily.
- Services and Dependency Injection in Angular allow components to be easily reused, tested, and maintained.
  - The feature helps larger projects as dependencies can be called from external sources, rather than created within the class.
- AOT for faster load time and increased security.

### Cons Of Angular

- Difficult to understand multilayer architecture of Angular.
  - Affect debugging on the frontend framework.
  - Debugging a sizeable Angular-based app can be an excruciating process.
- Web applications created with Angular have limited SEO options.
- Developers who are familiar with JavaScript will find Angular relatively difficult compared to React and Vue.

## Why React

React frontend framework is undoubtedly favorite frontend framework.

- React can easily be used across projects of different complexities.
- React gives the pace to build simple and scalable solutions.
- Developers no longer need to build components from scratch.
  - React’s vast numbers of libraries and tools drastically reduce development time.
  - Easy to use and integrate libraries
- Freedom to choose State Management Solutions
- React is arguably the most popular front-end framework.
- Need not to worry about maintenance and customization.
  - Has a vibrant community of developers
- **It’s easier to find a React developer for our team compared with other frameworks**.
- Bolierplate is simple and easy to configure.

  There isn’t a one-size-fits-all frontend framework.
  If you’re building a app and have very little time to spare, go for React or Vue.js.
  Choose Angular only if you’re building a complex web solution because the pain in debugging the app is real.
